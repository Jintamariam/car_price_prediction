# Car Price Prediction
This project aims to predict car prices based on various automobile-related characteristics using machine learning models.

### Project Overview
The main objective of this project is to build a predictive model that estimates the price of a car based on attributes like mileage, engine specifications, fuel type, and more. The dataset used contains several characteristics that influence car prices.

### Dataset Description
The dataset includes various features:

Mileage
Engine specifications
Seller type (e.g., dealer or individual)
Year of manufacturing
Sale price
Kilometers driven
Fuel type (e.g., petrol, diesel, CNG)
Type of transmission (manual or automatic)
Key Features
Data exploration and visualization using seaborn and matplotlib
Data preprocessing with MinMaxScaler and StandardScaler
Dimensionality reduction using PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
Model building using algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Performance evaluation using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared
### Libraries Used
numpy
pandas
seaborn
scikit-learn
matplotlib
